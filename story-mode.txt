story mode Objectives:
You must follow the same principles as the first subject and codebase of make-your-game.

For this project you must create a story mode, a mode in a computer game in which the player plays through a story.
Take for instance Super Mario where a story is being told in which the main character tries to save the princess.

Instructions:
A story must have some kind of logic and evolution, you must not simply write something on a board and it is done, no!

The story must have at least:
an introduction, the context and beginning of the story (should be shown before starting the game)
a development, the story reaches a waypoint (should be shown when you hit a specific score while playing)
a conclusion, the end of the story (should be shown when the game ends, either with a loss or a victory)

audit:
Does the game avoid the use of frameworks?
Is an introduction of the story provided in the beginning of the game?
Try playing the game and reach the specific score to make the development part of the story appear.
Does the development part of the story appear when you reach the specific score?
Try finishing the game (either win or lose).
Is a conclusion of the story provided when the game ends?
Does the game run at/or around 60fps?(from 50 to 60 or more)
Can you confirm that the paint is being used as little as possible?
Can you confirm that the layers are being used as little as possible?
Is layer creation being promoted properly?
Bonus:
+Is the story appealing and interesting?
+Is the code using asynchronicity to increase performance?
